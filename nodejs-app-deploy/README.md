This project aims to make spinning up a simple local Node.js test/development environment incredibly quick and easy, and to introduce new developers to the wonderful world of Node.js development on local virtual machines.

It will install the following on a CentOS 7 Linux VM:

  - Node.js (latest version in EPEL repository)
  - Express
  - A simple demonstration Node.js app

It should take 5-10 minutes to build or rebuild the VM from scratch on a decent broadband connection.

  1. [Edit your hosts file](http://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/modify-your-hosts-file/), adding the line `192.168.55.55  nodejs.test` so you can connect to the VM.
  2. Open your browser and access [http://nodejs.test/](http://nodejs.test/).
